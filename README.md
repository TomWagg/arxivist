# The ArXivist

This Chrome extension reorders the listings at [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org) based on your browsing history.
It keeps track of the papers that you have clicked on previously and it moves the "similar" papers to the top of the pile.

*Note: your history is only stored in local storage on your local computer and it is never communicated to an external server.*

## Installation

For now, you can install this by cloning the GitHub repository, navigating to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), turning on "developer mode", and then loading the repository directory as an "unpacked extension".
