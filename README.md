# The ArXivist

This browser extension reorders the listings at [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org) based on your browsing history.
It keeps track of the papers that you have clicked on previously and it moves the "similar" papers to the top of the pile.

*Note: your history is only stored in local storage on your local computer and it is never communicated to an external server.*

## Installation

You can install arxivist as a ~[Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arxivist/fmnaemfbhjjgdokfgboolpjhnfcdaime)~ or [Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/arxivist/).
*Note: this extension has been removed from the Chrome web store because it didn't have a screenshot. I'll try to get it re-submitted, but until then, Chrome users should follow the developer instructions below.*

## Developer installation

You can install the development version by cloning the GitHub repository, navigating to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), turning on "developer mode", and then loading the repository directory as an "unpacked extension".
